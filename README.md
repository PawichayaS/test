Description
Background
Speech impairments are very common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, knowledge of their objective characteristics and relationship to other motor symptoms amongst Asian PD patients is limited.
Objectives
To identify objective vowel sound characteristics in Thai PD patients and correlate with disease severity, as determined by UPDRS and various sub-scores.
Method
We evaluated 100 Thai PD patients, with a mean age of 66.56 years (±7.52) and HY of 2.7 (±1.08), and 101 age-matched controls. Phonatory evaluation, comprising of 15 objective parameters, was conducted using the Multi-Dimensional Voice Programme with a sustained /a/ phonation.
Results
PD patients exhibited significantly higher values of all dimensions of the phonatory parameters evaluated compared to controls (All, p < 0.001) except for duration of sustained phonation, which was significantly shorter in PD …
